### Me in 5 seconds
I am a technical and delivery focused Engineering leader with a range of experience in architecture, integration, testing and project management. Myers-Brigs said I am an INTP, so I am a logician.

### What I'm doing now
#### My work
Work at American Express as VP Engineer on the Loyalty Platform. Working with a very large team (for me) across all the Loyalty applications. Including 15 year old mainframe to new cloud based in memory compute platforms. 

#### Health and balance
Training for 100mile race, with no idea if it will still take place. Nursing a bum knee. 

#### Currently reading
Software architecture - Mark Richards and Neil Fords stuff is very good.
Implementing SLO - Getting into the SLO to help my SRE teams.
Lonesome Dove - Fictional western reading. Having fun.
